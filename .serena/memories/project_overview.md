# Project Overview: Harusari Website

## Purpose
Interactive album archive website for "하루살이 프로젝트 2: 알 수 없는 느낌" (Harusari Project 2: Unknown Feeling). This is a digital art piece disguised as a 90s/2000s-era desktop computer interface, featuring draggable windows, retro GUI elements, and hidden easter eggs.

## Core Concept
The website embodies the album's philosophy of "imperfection aesthetics" through:
- **Desktop metaphor** with clickable file icons and draggable windows
- **Intentional "broken" UI elements** and glitch effects
- **Hidden content discovery** through user interaction
- **Retro computing nostalgia** (Windows 98/2000 aesthetic)

## Key Features
- DOS-style boot sequence with authentic terminal loading
- Window management system with minimize/maximize/drag functionality
- Music player (Winamp-inspired) with audio visualization
- Image viewer with progressive loading effects
- Text viewer for album information and lyrics
- Secret files discoverable through easter eggs (click desktop 5 times)
- Taskbar with Windows 98-style navigation

## Digital Art Philosophy
"완벽하지 않은 균열 속에서 피어나는 예술적 가치" - artistic value blooming from imperfect cracks. The website intentionally breaks UX conventions to create an artistic experience reflecting the album's raw, experimental nature.
